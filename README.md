HTML SOURCERY
=============

WIZARDROUS
----------
```javascript
src = require('./html-sourcery');

var template = src.template(src.doctype(5), function(params) {
	return src.html([
		src.head([
			src.meta({ charset: 'utf-8' }),
			src.title(params.title)
		]),
		src.body([
			src.h1(params.title),
			src.h2('WIZARDROUS'),
			src.div({ class: 'container' }, [
				src.code('...'),
				src.p('Outputs:'),
				src.code('...')
			]),
			// empty footer
			src.footer()
		])
	])
});

console.log(template.compile({ title: 'HTML SOURCERY' }));
```

Outputs:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML><html><head><meta charset="utf-8"><title>HTML SOURCERY</title></head><body><h1>HTML SOURCERY</h1><h2>WIZARDROUS</h2><div class="container"><code>...</code><p>Outputs:</p><code>...</code></div><footer></footer></body></html>
```

Which, by the way, is valid HTML5. No self-closing tags here.

WHAT
----
It's a pure-Javascript library for conjuring up HTML, meant for use with node.

WHY
---
Data as code, code as data. Templating languages like to mix underpowered data formats with syntax-heavy games of Twister, and refuse to let you ```require``` in code you've already written. To quote a [wise man](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/the-emacs-problem): 
> I know, I know â€” everyone raves about the power of separating your code and your data ... But it's what you really want, or all the creepy half-languages wouldn't all evolve towards being Turing-complete, would they?

FAQ
---
> Can I use it?

Yes! Please.

> Does it support anything except HTML5?

Um. Well. Next week? Maybe.

> Can I use it without node?

I don't know!
